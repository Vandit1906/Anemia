# Anemia
In this anemia dataset, the attributes include Gender (coded as 0 for male and 1 for female), along with crucial hematological indicators such as Hemoglobin, MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration), MCV (mean corpuscular volume), and MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin). Hemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells, plays a vital role in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the body. MCH represents the average amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell, MCHC reflects the concentration of hemoglobin within a single cell, and MCV indicates the average size of red blood cells. The target variable, "Results," serves as the binary outcome, with 0 denoting non-anemic and 1 indicating anemic status. The objective here is to employ a machine learning binary classifier algorithm that leverages these attributes to predict whether a patient is likely to suffer from anemia. By training the model on this diverse dataset, it is expected to learn patterns and relationships within the provided features, ultimately aiding in accurate predictions regarding the presence or absence of anemia in patients.
